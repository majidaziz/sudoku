sudoku validation multithread

I DO NOT condone cheating so please read and understand my code than just copy pasta.

If you're viewing this as a student: 
You should know I did not receive 100 on this assignment. (I think I got 90)
The logic is still correct and a little overboard because from what I remember there are only a couple of errors in the final test case.
My program validates the entire sudoku board.
In order to achieve 100 on the assignment all you need to do is change the output of the results, I forgot exactly what you need to change but I do remember him saying the error was my program not outputting the correct error message.
ALSO I have been informed by other students that my code is "messy and confusing". Firstly, I disagree, also if you're going to cheat please dont insult my code if you're not going to construtively critique it.

If you're viewing this as a faculty member:
If you're upset students are using my code then change the assignment.
A professor at my transfer college created his own assignments which forced students to learn and apply the concepts.
At Chapman the assignments have not changed at all throughout my time here as a student which is honestly embarrassing given how much the school has invested in STEM.
Also, I paid about 10X more at Chapman than my junior college which is shocking at how much more my junior college professors cared than the ones at Chapman.
